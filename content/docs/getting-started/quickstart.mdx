description: Learn how to get started with the free and open-source Saastack React UI UI component library based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS
---

## Getting started

You can install Saastack React UI to any Node.js project.

You'll need to be familiar with Node.js, and have it installed.

## Setup Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm i autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Point Tailwind CSS to files you have `className=".."` in:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}' /* src folder, for example */],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add Tailwind CSS to a CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Install Saastack React UI

1. Install Flowbite and Saastack React UI:

```bash
npm i @qbitum/react-flat-ui # or yarn add flowbite @qbitum/react-flat-ui
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.js`, and include content from `@qbitum/react-flat-ui`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    ...,
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
  ],
  plugins: [..., require('flowbite/plugin')],
  ...
};
```

## Try it out

How you use Saastack React UI depends on your project setup. In general, you can just import the components you want to use from `@qbitum/react-flat-ui` and use them in a React `.jsx` file:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@qbitum/react-flat-ui';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
